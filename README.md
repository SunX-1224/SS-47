# SS-47 

SS-47 is an optimized microprocessor with reduced complex instruction sewhicht. Such hybridization of instruction set is done to speed up the processing in "Logisim-Evolution", which only game he clock speed of 1kHz.

It is a register based processor.

It comes with an Assembler and some demo programs for console I/O and screen I/O for some fun.

This is the best and faster CPU, I have designed in 1st year as a computer engineering student. So, enjoy the rest.

Assembly instructions are all present in some file inside it, so take a look before using it.

Thanks Logisim-Evolution for providing a best tool for logical circuit simulator.
